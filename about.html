            <h1>About the Asom Natya Sanmilon, Jorhat</h1><br><br>
            <p align="justify"> The great man Sankardev started the culture of Assamese drama in Assam with his drama
                “Chinhayatra”. The
                addition of Gunaviram Baruah’s “Ramnavami” in the middle part of 1982 century, the drama movement got a
                momentum in Assam. In this way people continued the development of drama movement in Assam since then.
                With a view to develop this movement the drama organization ‘Sadou Asom Akanka Nat Sanmilan’ got birth
                in Dibrugrah town under the presidentship of Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha and the Sanmilon continued its
                activities in the field of drama. After a few years in the convention held in Mangaldoi in 1967, the
                constitution was amended and the organisation was renamed as “Asom Natya Sanmilan.” Since then the
                organisation took step to open its branches in the different parts of Assam. Many big and profound
                personalities like Bishnu Prasad Rabha, Prafulla Kumar Baruah, Phunu Baruah, Krishna Prasad Baruah,
                Lakshyadhar Choudhury, Phani Talukdar, Arun Sharma Dr. Akhil Chakraborty, Dr. Yogendra Chetia, Abdul
                Mazid and many more decorated the presidential chair of the Asom Natya Sanmilan acknowledged as the
                national organization of Assam and created the environment for further development of drama culture in
                Assam.
                Asom Natya Sanmilan had organized one act drama competition from 1959 to 1967. It started full drama (90
                Minutes) competition in the year 1977 in place of one act drama. This step contributed immensely towards
                the creation of many renowned workers in the field of drama and many ideal and instructive drama’s.

                field of drama.

                the memory of Natya Silpi Brajnath Sarmah. In the memory of this great personality in the field of drama
                the Brajnath Sharma Award has been forwarded to the person helping the development of drama culture in
                Assam since 2010 every year.
